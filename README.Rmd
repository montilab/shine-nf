# shine-nf

[![Built With](https://img.shields.io/badge/Built%20With-Nextflow-brightgreen.svg)](https://www.nextflow.io/)

## Requirements

### Nextflow
Workflows are built using [Nextflow](https://www.nextflow.io/). Nextflow can be used on any POSIX compatible system (Linux, OS X, etc) and requires BASH and Java 8 (or higher) to be installed. Download the latest version of Nextflow:

```bash
$ curl -s https://get.nextflow.io | bash
```

Once downloaded make the `nextflow` file accessible by your $PATH variable so you do not have to specify the full path to nextflow each time. e.g. `nextflow run` rather than `path/to/nextflow run`

### R Packages
We suggest R 3.6.0 but we also support up top R 4.0.0. Workflows will expect the following R dependencies to be available:

```R
library(BDgraph)
library(Biobase)
library(Matrix)
library(magrittr)
library(optparse)
```

### Docker (Optional)

You can alternatively run workflows with Docker to ensure dependencies are available.

```
docker pull montilab/shine:latest
nextflow run wf.nf -with-docker montilab/shine
```

### Anaconda (Optional)
You can alterantive run workflows with a conda environment activated.

```
module load anaconda3

conda create -n shine python=3.7
source activate shine

conda install -c conda-forge r-base -y
conda install -c conda-forge r-bdgraph -y
conda install -c conda-forge r-optparse -y
conda install -c conda-forge r-matrix -y
conda install -c conda-forge r-magrittr -y

conda install -c bioconda bioconductor-biobase -y

nextflow run wf.nf 
```
